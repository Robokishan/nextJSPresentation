        If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place.
        When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next
        logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random
        Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple.
        Choose the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the
        button. Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons
        creating random paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some
        people use this generator are listed in the following paragraphs.
      </p>
      <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
      <p>
        Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get
        their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no
        idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
        forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common
        writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of
        a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random
        paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
        have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
        matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to
        use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
      </p>
      <h2>Tackle Writers' Block</h2>
      <p>
        A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle
        writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a
        current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a
        completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some
        of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first
        place.
      </p>
      <h2>Beginning Writing Routine</h2>
      <p>
        Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing
        routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to
        try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose
        here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes
        onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their
        fingers.
      </p>
      <h2>Writing Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Another writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the
        random paragraph and incorporate a single sentence from that into a new
        paragraph to create a short story. Unlike the
        <a href="https://randomwordgenerator.com/sentence.php">
          random sentence generator
        </a>
        , the sentences from the random paragraph will have some connection to
        one another so it will be a bit different. You also won't know exactly
        how many sentences will appear in the random paragraph.
      </p>
      <h2>Programmers</h2>
      <p>
        It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If
        you're a programmer who's working on a project where blocks of text are
        needed, this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to
        test your programming and that the tool being created is working well.
      </p>

        Above are a few examples of how the random paragraph generator can be
        beneficial. The best way to see if this random paragraph picker will be
        useful for your intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number
        of paragraphs to see if they are beneficial to your current project.

        If you do find this paragraph tool useful, please do us a favor and let
        us know how you're using it. It's greatly beneficial for us to know the
        different ways this tool is being used so we can improve it with
        updates. This is especially true since there are times when the
        generators we create get used in completely unanticipated ways from when
        we initially created them. If you have the time, please send us a quick
        note on what you'd like to see changed or added to make it better in the
        future.
